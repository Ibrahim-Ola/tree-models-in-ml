## Tree Models for Regression

This repository consists of a tutorial on an introduction to Tree models for Regression. I presented this at the GeoSMART Hackweek at the eScience Institute of the University of Washington, Seattle. The tutorial is deployed on [GeoSMART Website](https://geosmart.hackweek.io/tutorials/tree_models/Tree_Models_in_ML.html). Learn more about GeoSMART on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geo-smart/2023-hackweek-website/tree/main) and their [website](https://geosmart.hackweek.io/).
